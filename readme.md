#### design-done-lib
design-done-lib provides a set of stylings and components, which make it really easy to build a UI that doesn't suck (and works on mobile). The aim is NOT to be amazingly ingenious, but to be pretty decent (maybe even good) with little effort. It's meant for hackers, like myself, who don't like to spend much time and energy on interfaces and front-end stuff, but who understand that presentation is important. One example: https://mynowpage.herokuapp.com.

#### start using
All stlyes are in the design-done.css.scss file above. You can simply download it, or even just copy and paste the code. The code is really simple and straightforward. That is by design, so that things are not a pain to understand and edit, if you wish to diverge from the default stylings.

#### requirements
Sass. The stylings use nesting, so sass is required. (There are other ways to make this work, feel free to do so if you like.)

#### inspiration
Full disclosure. The design is shamelessly stolen from http://yoshuawuyts.com/workshop-distributed-patterns.
I was looking for an interface design to imitate for my last Rails projet, as I knew that I suck a graphical design and stumbled on this. I figured this looks so good and can pretty much be used for any thing, and that's why I set to write design-done-lib. To have these styles generatlized, and thereby have a way to genreated a good enough UI super quickly for any projects.
