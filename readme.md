design-done-lib provides a set of stylings and components that reduce the effort it takes to build a UI that doesn't suck to almost zero. The aim is not to be great or perfect, but to be pretty decent with very, very little effort. It's meant for hackers, like myself, who don't like to spend much time and energy on interfaces, but who understand that presentation is important. One example: https://mynowpage.herokuapp.com.

#### start using
All stlyes are in the design-done.css.scss file above. You can download it, or even just copy and paste the code. The code is kept as simple as possible in order to make adjusting it as painless as possible.

#### requirements
Sass. The stylings use nesting, so sass is required.

#### inspiration
Full disclosure. The design-done-design is shamelessly stolen from http://yoshuawuyts.com/workshop-distributed-patterns
Knowing that I suck at UI design, I was looking for a UI to imitate pretty closely for my last Rails project. I stumbled upon this site and instictively loved its simplicity. Then it dawned on me that these styles could very simply be generalized and then be used in almost any project to generate a rather decent UI super duper quickly with almost no effort. That was just what I was looking for. Design-done-lib is the result of this.

#### not finished
design-done-lib is ready to be used, but is also a work in progress. I will add (or substract) stuff as I use it for my own projects.
