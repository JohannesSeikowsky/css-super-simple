#### css-super-simple
css-super-simple is a ridiculously simple css/scss libraray that aims to get the effort you need to exert in order to generate an initial UI for your web-app (rails or other) as close as possible to zero.

aim is to be an 80/5 solution. 80% of the output, 5% or less of the input (your time and sweat that is)
