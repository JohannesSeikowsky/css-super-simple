Design-done-lib provides a set of stylings and components, which make it really easy to produce a UI that doesn't suck. The aim is not to be amazingly ingenious, but to be good enough with as little effort as possible. It's meant for hackers, like myself, who don't like to spend much time on interfaces and front-end stuff, but who understand that presentation is important. As an example, most pages of my last project use nothing but the design-done-lib styling: https://mynowpage.herokuapp.com.
