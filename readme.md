#### What does it do?
Design-done-lib provides a set of stylings and components that reduce the effort it takes to build a UI that doesn't suck to almost zero. The aim is not to be great, but to be pretty decent with almost no effort. It's meant for hackers, like myself, who don't like to spend much time and energy on interfaces, but who understand that presentation is important. A design-done-lib site: https://mynowpage.herokuapp.com.

#### How to begin?
All styles are in the design-done.css.scss file above. You can download it, or just copy and paste the code. The code is kept as simple as possible in order to make adjusting it as painless as possible. I'm also planning to make it a ruby gem for easy use in Rails projects.

#### Any requirements?
Sass. The stylings use nesting, so sass is required. (or your favorite workaround)

#### Use-Guide
+ add code to project (download or copy and paste)
+ some styles are applied immediately as a result
+ wrap logo in simple_logo class: `<div class="simple_logo"> ... </div>`
+ wrap header links in simple_header class: `<div class="simple_header"> ... </div>`
+ wrap all elements of the central page (headers, paragraphs, forms etc) in a simple_container class: `<div class="simple_container"> ... </div>`
+ wrap links within that simple_container in a button class: `<div class="button"> ... </div>`
+ be done with it.

#### Editable
The stylings are deliberately written to be very easy to edit. In fact, they are meant to be edited.

#### Inspiration
Full disclosure. The design-done-design is shamelessly stolen from http://yoshuawuyts.com/workshop-distributed-patterns
Knowing that I suck at UI design, I was looking for a UI to imitate pretty closely for my last Rails project. I stumbled upon this site and instictively loved its simplicity. Then it dawned on me that these styles could very simply be generalized and then be used in almost any project to generate a rather decent UI super duper quickly with almost no effort. Design-done-lib is the result.

**p.s** design-done-lib is ready for use, but it is also a work in progress. I will add (or substract) stuff as I use it in my own projects.
